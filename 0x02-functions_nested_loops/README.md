A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. In other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program.
  	      	      There are three aspects of a C function
		      Function declaration (prototype) A function must be declared globally in a c program to tell the                       compiler about the function name, function parameters, and return type.
		      Function call Function can be called from anywhere in the program. The parameter list must not d                       iffer in function calling and function declaration. We must pass the same number of functions as                       it is declared in the function declaration.
		      Function definition It contains the actual statements which are to be executed. It is the most im                      portant aspect to which the control comes when the function is called. Here, we must notice that
                      only one value can be returned from the function.
		      C - Header Files
A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files thatcomes with your compiler.
                      Nested Loops in C
A nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called “loop inside loops“. We can define any number of loops inside another loop
